Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.\nIf you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com ), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).\nIn addition, if the value of Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress.
