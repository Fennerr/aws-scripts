Include the single FieldToMatch type that you want to inspect, with additional specifications as needed, according to the type. You specify a single request component in FieldToMatch for each rule statement that requires it. To inspect more than one component of the web request, create a separate rule statement for each component.\nExample JSON for a QueryString field to match:\n\n\"FieldToMatch\": { \"QueryString\": {} }\nExample JSON for a Method field to match specification:\n\n\"FieldToMatch\": { \"Method\": { \"Name\": \"DELETE\" } }\n\nSingleHeader (dict) --Inspect a single header.

This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.\nOnly the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request body are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. For information about how to handle oversized request bodies, see the Body object configuration.\n\nOversizeHandling (string) --What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the body of a web request when the body exceeds 8 KB (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body are forwarded to WAF by the underlying host service.\nThe options for oversize handling are the following:\n\nCONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.\nMATCH - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.\nNO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.\n\nYou can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings for oversize handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block any request whose body is over 8 KB.\nDefault: CONTINUE\n\n\n\nMethod (dict) --Inspect the HTTP method.

See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .\nYou must specify either this setting or the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.\n\nIncludedPaths (list) --Match only the specified include paths. See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .\nProvide the include paths using JSON Pointer syntax. For example, \"IncludedPaths\": [\"/dogs/0/name\", \"/dogs/1/name\"] . For information about this syntax, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer .\nYou must specify either this setting or the All setting, but not both.\n\nNote\nDon't use this option to include all paths. Instead, use the All setting.\n\n\n(string) --\n\n\n\n\nMatchScope (string)[REQUIRED]The parts of the JSON to match against using the MatchPattern . If you specify All , WAF matches against keys and values.\n\nInvalidFallbackBehavior (string) --What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body. The options are the following:\n\nEVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body as plain text. WAF applies the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to the body text string.\nMATCH - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.\nNO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.\n\nIf you don't provide this setting, WAF parses and evaluates the content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.\nWAF does its best to parse the entire JSON body, but might be forced to stop for reasons such as invalid characters, duplicate keys, truncation, and any content whose root node isn't an object or an array.\nWAF parses the JSON in the following examples as two valid key, value pairs:\n\nMissing comma: {\"key1\":\"value1\"\"key2\":\"value2\"}\nMissing colon: {\"key1\":\"value1\",\"key2\"\"value2\"}\nExtra colons: {\"key1\"::\"value1\",\"key2\"\"value2\"}\n\n\nOversizeHandling (string) --What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the Headers object, to define the set of headers to and the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.\nOnly the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's headers and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the headers that it receives from the underlying host service.\n\nMatchPattern (dict)[REQUIRED]The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request.\nYou must specify exactly one setting: either All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .\nExample JSON: \"MatchPattern\": { \"ExcludedHeaders\": {\"KeyToExclude1\", \"KeyToExclude2\"} }\n\nAll (dict) --Inspect all headers.\n\nIncludedHeaders (list) --Inspect only the headers that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.\n\n(string) --\n\n\nExcludedHeaders (list) --Inspect only the headers whose keys don't match any of the strings specified here.\n\n(string) --\n\n\n\n\nMatchScope (string)[REQUIRED]The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify All , WAF inspects both keys and values.\n\nOversizeHandling (string)[REQUIRED]What WAF should do if the headers of the request are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.\nThe options for oversize handling are the following:\n\nCONTINUE - Inspect the headers normally, according to the rule inspection criteria.\nMATCH - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF applies the rule action to the request.\nNO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.\n\n\n\n\nCookies (dict) --Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and pattern matching filters in the Cookies object, to define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.\nOnly the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's cookies and only the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You must configure how to handle any oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters to the cookies that it receives from the underlying host service.\n\nMatchPattern (dict)[REQUIRED]The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request.\nYou must specify exactly one setting: either All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .\nExample JSON: \"MatchPattern\": { \"IncludedCookies\": {\"KeyToInclude1\", \"KeyToInclude2\", \"KeyToInclude3\"} }\n\nAll (dict) --Inspect all cookies.\n\nIncludedCookies (list) --Inspect only the cookies that have a key that matches one of the strings specified here.\n\n(string) --\n\n\nExcludedCookies (list) --Inspect only the cookies whose keys don't match any of the strings specified here.\n\n(string) --\n\n\n\n\nMatchScope (string)[REQUIRED]The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria.

WAF applies the rule action to the request.\nNO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagedByFirewallManager (boolean) --Indicates whether the logging configuration was created by Firewall Manager, as part of an WAF policy configuration. If true, only Firewall Manager can modify or delete the configuration.\n\nLoggingFilter (dict) --Filtering that specifies which web requests are kept in the logs and which are dropped.
